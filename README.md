# Never-Not-Numlock

Never Not Numlock is a simple Windows System Tray app that monitors your Numlock key.  
If the numlock is EVER turned off, the app springs into action, popping up a 
notification which CAN NOT BE DISMISSED until Numlock is turned back on.

Just go to /publish and double click `NeverNotNumlock.application` to install the
tool as a `Click-Once` app.

That's it.
